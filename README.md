# Project BoyerBach – A Lecture Series on the History of Mathematics

> A chronologically anchored, philosophically weighted, and mathematically rigorous lecture series following Boyer & Merzbach (3rd ed.).

This repository hosts a 12-part lecture series created by Harley Caham Combest for MATH4991 (Summer 2025, under Dr. Roche), focused on the historical, conceptual, and symbolic development of mathematics as framed in the third edition of *A History of Mathematics* by Carl B. Boyer and Uta C. Merzbach.

Each lecture includes:
- A YouTube video
- PDF notes (LaTeX-compiled)
- Optional Jupyter annotations or supplemental files
